# Overlook Hotel


## Abstract
In this final project for my second term at Turing School of Software Design, I used Fetch, NPM, Mocha, Chai (including chai spies), Webpack, HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript, and jQuery in order to create a website for a fictional establishment, Overlook Hotel. It accommodates two types of users - one manager and fifty customers. Each customer is able to view available rooms by type for a particular date and make a booking. They can also see all past, current, and future bookings. The manager is able to make bookings on an existing customer's behalf and view all available rooms for a particular day by type. They're also able to see an overview of all hotel information, such as the daily revenue, the number of available rooms for that day, and the percentage of rooms that are currently booked. 

## Install/Setup
You install this application by cloning the repository using the command `git clone`. After you have cloned and entered the repository on your local computer, you can input the command `npm install` in order to install necessary dependencies. Finally, you can run `npm start` in a separate tab and view the link to a server listed in the ensuing information in order to access the site. The deployed version is also available here: https://garnetred.github.io/overlook-hotel/.

## Challenges 
One of the biggest challenges was determining how to organize my code into separate files and classes in order to follow best practices. I was able to successfully separate my class and presentation logic. I also had some difficulty implementing chai spies initially, but I was able to implement them for methods being called in the domUpdates class and to mock out fetch calls. I wasn't able to implement it for one class method that was invoked within the class being tested, but I hope to learn more about accomplishing this moving forward. 

## Site Demos
